# Object Orientated Programing (OOP)
* Everything in OOP is an object and objects are modelled against real world objects
* Make templates of an object that have attributes (variables) and behaviours/methods (functions)
* Classes are the templates we use to create objects
* Classes are a way of bringing both the data and functionality of our code together
